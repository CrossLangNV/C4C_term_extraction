"""
methods/API/... to classify the contact information further into address, telephone number, email, opening hours...

TODO
 - Implement 4 classifiers,
 - Implement combined classifier
 - Have an API.
 - Write connector for this API
 - connect to CPSV-AP pipeline, see other repo
 - Check the data that classifies contact info, perhaps we can use something from that.
 - Write REGEX code for some of the classifiers, e.g.
    - telephone numbers: 'numbers, spaces, dots, slashes'
    - opening hours is all about hours and days.
    - Address (?), street + number + city?
